## Project 1: Build a Tribute Page
### Description
This project consists on writing HTML and CSS to create a tribute page. In this case I chose to make one for [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien). The page has been coded to be responsive so feel free to resize the window or open it on a mobile device to observe how content adapts.

### How to run?
Download the project then open the main.html file with a web browser. To view the website in a mobile device either use the browser's simulator or serve the HTML file by running an HTTP server on your computer. The latter can be easily made by opening a terminal window, changing to the project's directory and running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` . After this, access the website by going to http://host-local-ip:8000/main.html.
