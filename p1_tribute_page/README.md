## Project 1: Build a Tribute Page
### Description
This project consists on writing HTML and CSS to create a tribute page. In this case I chose to make one for [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien). The page has been coded to be responsive so feel free to resize the window or open it on a mobile device to observe how content adapts.
