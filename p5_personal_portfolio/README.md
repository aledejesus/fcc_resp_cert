## Project 5: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
### Description
This project consists on writing HTML and CSS to create a personal portfolio webpage. In this website I will showcase the programming projects I have made so far. The page has been coded to be responsive so feel free to resize the window or open it on a mobile device to observe how content adapts.
