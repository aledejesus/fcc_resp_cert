## Project 3: Build a Product Landing Page
### Description
This project consists on writing HTML and CSS to create a product landing page. In this case I chose to make one for a nonexistent company called Koi Fish Media which offers photos and videos of Koi fish. The page has been coded to be responsive so feel free to resize the window or open it on a mobile device to observe how content adapts.
